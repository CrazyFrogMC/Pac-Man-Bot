@ 'Welcome to Pac-Man Bot!';

#Controls:
This game is played in turns by adding or removing a reaction. The arrow emotes will move Pac-Man, and the skip emote will toggle fast-forward mode. In fast-forward mode, the arrows move Pac-Man until you reach an intersection or hit something.
To win, you must collect all the pellets, while avoiding the ghosts. Try to get a high score!

#Commands: @
\"{prefix}display\" - Switch between normal and mobile mode
\"{prefix}bump\" - Move game message to the bottom of the chat
\"{prefix}cancel\" - End the game unless someone is playing
\"{prefix}help\" and \"{prefix}about\" - More information;

#Tips:
• Each eaten ghost during the same power mode yields twice as many points as the last!
• Eat the fruit that spawns after eating a large amount of pellets for extra points!
• Blinky chases you, Pinky tries to ambush you, Inky will follow Blinky's lead, and Clyde is kind of shy. 4 times during the game they will scatter and stop chasing you.
• The ghosts can't turn 180º unless they're Eatable or switching modes

@ 'Add any reaction to return to the game'
